- [Uricchio et al., 2016. Selection and explosive growth alter genetic architecture and hamper the detection of causal rare variants.](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/7/863.abstract)
    - Develop a phenotype model based off Simons et al. 2014 and Eyre-Walker 2010 that incorporates selective coefficients, effect sizes, and peiotropic effects
    - Evaluate their model with simulation and RNAseq of 360 individuals with European ancestry
    - Demographic factors (particularly population expansion) can increase the impact of rare alleles on trait variation
    - Approaches that bin markers to try to capture the effect of rare alleles of large effect perform poorly because they ignore evolution of rare alleles
- [Faino et al., 2016. Transposons passively and actively contribute to evolution of the two-speed genome of a fungal pathogen.](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/06/20/gr.204974.116.abstract)
    - Transposable elements are a mechanism for ``genomic plasticity'' that allows for adaptation
    - Virulence loci in *Verticillium dahliae* evolve through error-prone double stranded break repair and gene duplication mediated by transposable elements
- [Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2016. Evidence for the fixation of gene duplications by positive selection in Drosophila](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/6/787.abstract)
    - Most gene duplications in a *Drosophila* diversity panel are at low frequency, evidence of being under purifying selection
    - Nine gene duplications (of ~500 in the panel) are near fixation in at least one subpopulation, and linked SNPs show evidence of positive selection
- [Dhokarh and Abyzov, 2016](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/05/23/gr.205484.116.abstract)
    - Examined heterozygous deletions in 1000 Genomes data with synthetic long read sequencing data
    - Found ~2-fold higher mutation rate for regions in-phase with the deletion than regions out-of-phase
    - Posit that mechanisms that generate CNV are error-prone and may explain hypermutable regions
- [Hsiao et al., 2016. Alternative splicing modulated by genetic variants demonstrates accelerated evolution regulated by highly conserved proteins.](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/03/09/gr.193359.115.abstract)
    - Identification of genetic variants associated with alternative splicing.
    - Exons, introns, and SNPs associated with alternative splicing show accelerated evolution in primates.
    - Propose that the machinery is highly conserved, and shows strong allele bias.
- [Keith et al., 2015. High mutational rates of large-scale duplication and deletion in Daphnia pulex.](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2015/12/14/gr.191338.115.abstract)
	- Mutation accumulation (MA) study in _Daphnia_
	- Estimates of base substitution rate similar to other Eukaryotes
	- Estimates of CNV much higher than those observed in other MA studies
	- Evidence of meiotic and mitotic gene conversion (GC), with mitotic tract lengths being longer
	- Evidence of purifying selection against CNV in natual populations

- [Li et al., 2015. Phylogenomic evidence for ancient hybridization in the genomes of living cats (Felidae)](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2015/11/30/gr.186668.114.abstract)
	- Disconcordance between autosomal, mt-linked, X-linked, and Y-linked phylogenies

- [He et al., 2015. A probabilistic method for testing and estimating selection differences between populations. 25(12):1903-9](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/12/1903.abstract)
	- Probabilistic models of drift and selective coefficients to test for differential selection between populations
	- Interesting: difference in selective coefficients is approximately normally distributed

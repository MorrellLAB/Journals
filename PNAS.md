[Linear mixed model for heritability estimation that explicitly addresses environmental variation](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7377.abstract?sid=ca87578e-b46b-4505-a63e-d15ccbf779d2)
 - Looks at estimating heritability using a linear mixed model
 - Talks about concerns of using a standard LMM and how to solve these issues

### Jun Inoue *et al.* 2015 
[Rapid genome reshaping by multiple-gene loss after whole-genome duplication in teleost fish suggested by mathematical modeling.](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/48/14918.abstract?sid=c3540042-d518-4de1-965c-96b4feae894c)
 - Models rates of genome reshaping after whole-genome duplication events
 - Shows that reshaping happend just before a major divergence in [teleost](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Teleostei) fish, while gene loss happened just after, creating a useful set of marker genes in the teleosts

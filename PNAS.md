[Rapid genome reshaping by multiple-gene loss after whole-genome duplication in teleost fish suggested by mathematical modeling.](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/48/14918.abstract?sid=c3540042-d518-4de1-965c-96b4feae894c)

 - Models rates of genome reshaping after whole-genome duplication events
 - Shows that reshaping happend just before a major divergence in [teleost](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Teleostei) fish, while gene loss happened just after, creating a useful set of marker genes in the teleosts

# Journals
##Recent finds in journals covering genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology.

Each contributor listed below should add a file that will include entries from the journal you are following. Each entry can be dated and include comments. I'm using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for easy formatting on Github. Adding new content to the top of the file will make it easier to find new content. See PLoS_Genetics.md for example formatting. As a reminder, the list of journals and contributors is below.

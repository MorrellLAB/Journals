#### [Domestication selected for deceleration of the circadian clock in cultivated tomato](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v48/n1/abs/ng.3447.html?WT.ec_id=NG-201601&spMailingID=50351289&spUserID=MTM2ODcxODY4NzAzS0&spJobID=824210033&spReportId=ODI0MjEwMDMzS0)
This paper presents evidence that the circadian clock of tomato slowed as a result of artificial selection / domestication and increasing distance from the equator. The authors describe allelic variation at an *Arabidopsis* homologue as responsible for phase delay, and - noting very low genetic diversity at this locus in cultivated tomato - suggest that the genetic region was under a selective sweep.

#### [Hybridization of powdery mildew strains gives rise to pathogens on novel agricultural crop species] (http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v48/n2/full/ng.3485.html)
This letter describes genome sequencing of 47 powdery mildew (*Blumeria graminis*) *formae speciales* that infect wheat, rye, and triticale. Triticale is a man-made hybrid of wheat and rye, and this paper presents evidence to suggest that the powdery mildew strain *B. graminis* f.sp. *triticale* (which infects triticale) is the result of a hybridization event between powdery mildew strains that infect wheat and rye. Intriguingly, the evolutionary history of the hosts wheat, rye, triticale, and durum (tetraploid wheat) mirrors that of the pathogens that infect them.

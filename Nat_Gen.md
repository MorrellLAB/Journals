This paper presents evidence that the circadian clock of tomato slowed as a result of artificial selection / domestication and increasing distance from the equator. The authors describe allelic variation at an *Arabidopsis* homologue as responsible for phase delay, and - noting very low genetic diversity at this locus in cultivated tomato - suggest that the genetic region was under a selective sweep.

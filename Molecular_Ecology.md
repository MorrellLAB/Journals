# Molecular Ecology Articles
### Here is a list of papers from Molecular Ecology that look insteresting to me:
(I really have no idea what to look for.)

1. [Qiu, S., Bergero, R., Guirao-Rico, S., Campos, J. L., Cezard, T., Gharbi, K. and Charlesworth, D. (2016), RAD mapping reveals an evolving, polymorphic and fuzzy boundary of a plant pseudoautosomal region. Mol Ecol, 25: 414–430. doi:10.1111/mec.13297](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.13297/full)
   - Literally the only paper from this issue that mentioned plants
   - Something about the loss of recombination between sex chromosomes with evolution
2. [Parat, F., Schwertfirm, G., Rudolph, U., Miedaner, T., Korzun, V., Bauer, E., Schön, C.-C. and Tellier, A. (2016), Geography and end use drive the diversification of worldwide winter rye populations. Mol Ecol, 25: 500–514. doi:10.1111/mec.13495]
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.13495/full)
   - Studies genetic diversity in cultivated rye
   - Analysis of diversity level versus improvement level of the crop
   - Found evidence of multiple domestication events
3. [Roschanski, A. M., Csilléry, K., Liepelt, S., Oddou-Muratorio, S., Ziegenhagen, B., Huard, F., Ullrich, K. K., Postolache, D., Vendramin, G. G. and Fady, B. (2016), Evidence of divergent selection for drought and cold tolerance at landscape and local scales in Abies alba Mill. in the French Mediterranean Alps. Mol Ecol, 25: 776–794. doi:10.1111/mec.13516]

   - silver fir trees have different alleles based on elevation
   - might be useful for WBDC geografic stuff???

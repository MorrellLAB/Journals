### February 2016
[The Role of Recombination in Evolutionary Rescue](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/2/721)
  - Thought provoking article exploring the dynamics of recombination and adaptation.  Recombination can bring favorable gene combination together but can also break them up.  If a sudden environmental shift occurs, how does recombination play into the survival (or extinction) of a species?

[A Delicate Balance Between Repair and Replication Factors Regulates Recombination Between Divergent DNA Sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/2/525)
 - Something for those are interested in mechanisms of recombination and molecular biology in general

[Estimating Relatedness in the Presence of Null Alleles
Kang Huang](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/1/247)
  - Provides a framework for how to estimate relatedness when there may be null alleles present, which can cause over or under representation of the degree of relatedness

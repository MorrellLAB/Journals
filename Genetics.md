[Natural Selection and Recombination Rate Variation Shape Nucleotide Polymorphism Across the Genomes of Three Related Populus Species](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/3/1185)
  - Looked at whole genome resequencing data to characterize and compare genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism, site frequency spectrum, and population-scaled recombination rates in three species of Populus
  - Concluded that Differences in effective population sizes and rates of recombination largely explain the disparate magnitudes and signatures of linked selection that we observe among species

[Genomic Patterns of Geographic Differentiation in Drosophila simulans](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/3/1229)
  - Examined genomic patterns of genetic differentiation between northen and southern populations of D. simulans, in particular looking for evidence parallel differentiation. 
  - Strongest support for parallel differentiation is in genomic regions that are associated with regulation. 
  - Comparisons to Drosophila melanogaster yielded potential candidate genes involved in local adaptation in both species, providing insight into common selective pressures and responses


### February 2016
[The Role of Recombination in Evolutionary Rescue](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/2/721)
  - Thought provoking article exploring the dynamics of recombination and adaptation.  Recombination can bring favorable gene combination together but can also break them up.  If a sudden environmental shift occurs, how does recombination play into the survival (or extinction) of a species?

[A Delicate Balance Between Repair and Replication Factors Regulates Recombination Between Divergent DNA Sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/2/525)
 - Something for those are interested in mechanisms of recombination and molecular biology in general

[Estimating Relatedness in the Presence of Null Alleles
Kang Huang](http://www.genetics.org/content/202/1/247)
  - Provides a framework for how to estimate relatedness when there may be null alleles present, which can cause over or under representation of the degree of relatedness

I know this isn't a journal that we are following, but this looks cool:  

[1] Differential introgression and the maintanance of species boundaries in an advanced generation avian hybrid zone. 20016. Walsh et al.  

* Selection and differential fitness effects on introgression across hybrid zones.  
* Geographic and genomic cline analyses (FSTAT, STRUCTURE, GENEPOP)
